I will create a simple static website using Python and Flask. The website will display "Fabian was here" on the homepage and listen on port 80.

First, let's create the necessary files and folders for the project:

1. main.py: This is the entry point of the application.
2. templates: This folder will contain the HTML templates.
3. templates/index.html: This is the HTML template for the homepage.
4. requirements.txt: This file will list the required packages for the project.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Static Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fabian was here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

requirements.txt
```
Flask==2.1.1
```

Now, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the application by executing `python main.py`.
3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost` or `http://<your_server_ip>` to see the "Fabian was here" message.

The website is now running on port 80 and displays "Fabian was here" on the homepage.
